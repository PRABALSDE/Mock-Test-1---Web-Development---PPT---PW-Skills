Execution context is an important concept in JavaScript that defines the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It includes variables, functions, objects, and the scope chain that determines the accessibility of variables and functions during runtime. Each time a function is invoked or code is executed, a new execution context is created.

There are three types of execution contexts in JavaScript: global execution context, function execution context, and eval execution context. Let's explore each of them in detail:

1)Global Execution Context:-
The global execution context is the default and outermost context in JavaScript.
It represents the environment in which the global code is executed, which includes top-level code outside of any functions.
There is only one global execution context per JavaScript program.
Variables and functions declared in the global scope are accessible from any part of the program.

2)Function Execution Context:-
Whenever a function is invoked, a new function execution context is created.
Each function has its own execution context, which includes its local variables, arguments, and a reference to its outer environment (lexical scope).
The function execution context is pushed onto the top of the call stack, allowing JavaScript to keep track of the function calls.
When a function finishes executing, its execution context is popped off the call stack, and control returns to the previous execution context.

3)Eval Execution Context:-
The eval() function in JavaScript can execute code dynamically by evaluating strings as code.
When the eval() function is called, a new eval execution context is created.
The eval execution context is similar to the function execution context but with some differences, such as having its own variable and function declarations.
Here is a simplified diagram illustrating the relationship between these execution contexts:

|                   |
|  Arguments        |
|  Variables        |
|  Scope Chain      |
|  Outer Environment|
|                   |

In the diagram, the global execution context is at the top, followed by one or more function execution contexts. Each function execution context has its own set of variables, scope chain, and a reference to its outer environment (lexical scope).

When a function is called from another function, a new function execution context is created and added on top of the call stack. Once the function finishes executing, its execution context is removed from the call stack, and control returns to the previous execution context.

This stack-like structure helps manage the flow of execution and ensures that variables and functions are accessed in the correct scope.
